# Hello Ring

The smallest Ring + shadow-cljs app I could imagine on short notice.

## How to run

Run the backend:

```shell
$ clj -M:dev
```

Run the frontend build process & server:

```shell
$ yarn dev
```

Browse to the frontend server process launched by shadow-cljs (probably http://localhost:9631).
